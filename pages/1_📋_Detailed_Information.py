st.markdown("""
If you want your GHG emissions data certified, please contact our auditor for a virtual ISO 14064 audit. We will review your data, provide feedback, and issue certification if requirements are met.

### What is ISO 14064?
ISO 14064 is an international standard for quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals. It provides a framework for organizations to:
- Quantify their GHG emissions
- Develop GHG inventories
- Report GHG emissions
- Validate and verify GHG assertions

### Certification Process:
1. **Data Review**: Our auditors review your emissions data
2. **Virtual Audit**: Conduct a virtual audit session
3. **Feedback**: Provide recommendations for improvement
4. **Certification**: Issue ISO 14064 certification if requirements are met
