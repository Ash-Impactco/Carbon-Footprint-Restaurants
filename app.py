# Restaurant GHG Emissions Data Entry

Welcome! This dashboard helps small-scale restaurants track their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ISO 14064 audits and sustainability. Please enter your data for the past year. Each section below covers a different type of emission (Scope 1, 2, 3). If you need certification, please contact us after completing your data entry.

**Other indirect emissions from the value chain (upstream and downstream).**
##### Upstream (before the restaurant):

- *Capital goods*: Emissions from manufacturing kitchen equipment, gas stoves, furniture.
- *Fuel and energy-related activities*: Emissions from fuel extraction, refining, and transport.
- *Upstream transportation*: Transport of ingredients and goods from suppliers to the restaurant.
- *Waste generated in operations*: Food waste, packaging waste, wastewater disposal.
- *Employee commuting*: Staff traveling to and from the restaurant.
- *Business travel*: Travel to vendor meetings, conferences, training, etc.
- *Upstream leased assets*: If the restaurant rents the space, emissions from the building's operation.
##### Downstream (after the restaurant):
- *Delivery services by third parties*: Swiggy/Zomato delivery bikes/scooters.
- *Customer transportation*: Emissions from customers driving/riding to the restaurant.
- *End-of-life treatment of sold products*: Disposal of takeaway containers, plastic bags, cutlery.
- *Franchisee emissions*: If the restaurant operates under a brand or franchise model.
