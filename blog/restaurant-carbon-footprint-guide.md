# Complete Guide to Restaurant Carbon Footprint Calculation

*Published on [Date] | By Carbon Calculator Team*

## Introduction

In today's environmentally conscious world, restaurants are increasingly being asked to measure and reduce their carbon footprint. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about calculating your restaurant's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, understanding the different scopes, and getting certified.

## What is a Carbon Footprint?

A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) emitted directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event, or product. For restaurants, this includes everything from the energy used in cooking to the emissions from ingredient transportation.

## The Three Scopes of GHG Emissions

### ðŸ”¥ Scope 1: Direct Emissions

**Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by your restaurant.**

These are emissions that occur directly at your restaurant location:

- **LPG/Natural Gas combustion**: Used for cooking dosa, idli, vada, sambar, and other dishes
- **Diesel or petrol used in generators**: For backup power during electricity cuts
- **Refrigerant leakage**: From refrigerators, cold storage, and air conditioners
- **Company-owned delivery vehicles**: Two-wheelers or vans owned by the restaurant for food delivery

**Why it matters**: These are emissions you have direct control over and can reduce through operational changes.

### ðŸ’¡ Scope 2: Indirect Emissions from Energy

**Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.**

These emissions occur at power plants and other energy generation facilities:

- **Purchased electricity from the grid**: Used for lighting, fans, rice cookers, mixers/grinders, refrigerators, billing systems
- **Purchased chilled water or steam**: If your restaurant uses central cooling or solar-heated steam systems

**Why it matters**: While you don't control the power plant, you can reduce these emissions by using energy more efficiently or switching to renewable energy sources.

### ðŸ›µ Scope 3: Other Indirect Emissions

**Other indirect emissions from your value chain (upstream and downstream).**

This is the largest and most complex category, covering emissions throughout your entire supply chain:

#### Upstream (Before Your Restaurant)

- **Purchased goods and ingredients**: Emissions from growing and transporting rice, lentils, vegetables, milk, ghee, spices, oil
- **Capital goods**: Emissions from manufacturing kitchen equipment, gas stoves, furniture
- **Fuel and energy-related activities**: Emissions from fuel extraction, refining, and transport
- **Upstream transportation**: Transport of ingredients and goods from suppliers to your restaurant
- **Waste generated in operations**: Food waste, packaging waste, wastewater disposal
- **Employee commuting**: Staff traveling to and from the restaurant
- **Business travel**: Travel to vendor meetings, conferences, training, etc.
- **Upstream leased assets**: If you rent your space, emissions from the building's operation

#### Downstream (After Your Restaurant)

- **Delivery services by third parties**: Swiggy/Zomato delivery bikes/scooters
- **Customer transportation**: Emissions from customers driving/riding to your restaurant
- **End-of-life treatment of sold products**: Disposal of takeaway containers, plastic bags, cutlery
- **Franchisee emissions**: If you operate under a brand or franchise model
- **Downstream leased assets**: Use of spaces or kitchens managed by others

**Why it matters**: Scope 3 often represents 70-90% of a restaurant's total emissions, making it crucial for comprehensive carbon management.

## How to Calculate Your Restaurant's Carbon Footprint

### Step 1: Gather Your Data

Start by collecting the following information for the past year:

**Energy & Fuel:**
- LPG consumption (kg/year)
- Generator fuel consumption (liters/year)
- Electricity consumption (kWh/year)

**Ingredients:**
- Rice purchased (kg/year)
- Vegetables purchased (kg/year)
- Milk purchased (liters/year)
- Other key ingredients

**Operations:**
- Number of staff
- Customer visits per year
- Delivery orders per year
- Food waste generated (kg/year)
- Packaging waste generated (kg/year)

### Step 2: Use Emission Factors

Emission factors convert your activity data into carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. Here are the Indian emission factors we use:

| Source | Factor | Unit |
|--------|--------|------|
| LPG | 2.983 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Diesel | 2.68 | kg CO2e/liter |
| Petrol | 2.31 | kg CO2e/liter |
| Electricity | 0.82 | kg CO2e/kWh |
| Rice | 2.7 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Lentils | 0.9 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Vegetables | 0.5 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Milk | 1.4 | kg CO2e/liter |
| Ghee | 8.0 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Spices | 1.5 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Cooking Oil | 3.3 | kg CO2e/liter |
| Food Waste | 1.9 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Packaging | 2.5 | kg CO2e/kg |
| Transport | 0.15 | kg CO2e/km |
| Commute | 0.12 | kg CO2e/km |
| Business Travel | 0.15 | kg CO2e/km |
| Delivery | 0.3 | kg CO2e/order |
| Customer Visit | 0.2 | kg CO2e/visit |
| Takeaway Container | 0.05 | kg CO2e/container |

### Step 3: Calculate Emissions

Multiply your activity data by the corresponding emission factors:

**Scope 1 = (LPG Ã— 2.983) + (Generator Fuel Ã— 2.68)**
**Scope 2 = Electricity Ã— 0.82**
**Scope 3 = Sum of all ingredient, waste, transport, and other emissions**

**Total = Scope 1 + Scope 2 + Scope 3**

## ISO 14064 Certification

### What is ISO 14064?

ISO 14064 is an international standard for quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals. It provides a framework for organizations to:
- Quantify their GHG emissions
- Develop GHG inventories
- Report GHG emissions
- Validate and verify GHG assertions

### Why Get Certified?

1. **Credibility**: Third-party verification adds credibility to your emissions claims
2. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements and customer demands
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Stand out as an environmentally responsible business
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Identify areas for emission reduction
5. **Stakeholder Trust**: Build trust with customers, investors, and partners

### Certification Process

1. **Data Review**: Our auditors review your emissions data and methodology
2. **Virtual Audit**: Conduct a virtual audit session to verify your processes
3. **Feedback**: Provide recommendations for improvement and compliance
4. **Certification**: Issue ISO 14064 certification if requirements are met
5. **Ongoing Support**: Provide guidance for maintaining and improving your carbon management

### What We Look For

During the certification process, we verify:

## Case Study: Medium-Sized Restaurant

Let's look at a typical medium-sized restaurant's carbon footprint:

**Annual Data:**
- LPG: 500 kg
- Generator fuel: 100 liters
- Electricity: 12,000 kWh
- Rice: 2,000 kg
- Vegetables: 1,500 kg
- Milk: 1,000 liters
- Staff: 8 people
- Customers: 15,000 visits
- Food waste: 500 kg

**Calculations:**
- Scope 1: (500 Ã— 2.983) + (100 Ã— 2.68) = 1,491.5 + 268 = 1,759.5 kg CO2e
- Scope 2: 12,000 Ã— 0.82 = 9,840 kg CO2e
- Scope 3: Various calculations = ~15,000 kg CO2e
- **Total: ~26.6 tonnes CO2e/year**

**Breakdown:**
- Scope 1: 6.6%
- Scope 2: 37.0%
- Scope 3: 56.4%
